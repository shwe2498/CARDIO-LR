This preference is based on several factors: DOACs have a lower risk of intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin, which is particularly important in patients prone to falls. Additionally, DOACs don't require regular INR monitoring, making medication management simpler for patients with cognitive impairment. Specifically, apixaban might be the most appropriate DOAC as it has shown the lowest bleeding risk in elderly populations. However, renal function must be assessed before prescribing, and dose adjustment may be necessary.

    "**Key advantages over simpler methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relation-specific transformations**: Unlike regular GCNs, R-GCN handles different types of medical relationships (treats, causes, interacts_with, etc.) with distinct parameter matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-hop reasoning**: Can connect distant concepts through intermediate nodes, essential for complex clinical reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path attention mechanism**: Learns to focus on clinically relevant paths, filtering noise common in medical knowledge graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contextualization**: Adapts entity representations based on graph neighborhood, enabling condition-specific recommendations"
