```

### API Usage

```python
from pipeline import CardiologyLightRAG

# Initialize the system
system = CardiologyLightRAG()

# Process a clinical query with patient context
query = "What are the first-line treatments for stable angina?"
patient_context = "Patient has diabetes and hypertension"

answer, explanation = system.process_query(query, patient_context)

print("Clinical Answer:")
print(answer)
print("\nClinical Reasoning:")
print(explanation)
```

## System Components

1. **Hybrid Retriever**: Retrieves relevant information using both vector embeddings and knowledge graph traversal.

2. **Knowledge Graph**: Integrates medical knowledge from multiple sources (UMLS, SNOMED CT, DrugBank).

3. **Subgraph Extractor**: Extracts relevant portions of the knowledge graph for a given query.

4. **Patient Context Processor**: Analyzes and integrates patient-specific information.

5. **Biomedical Generator**: Generates clinically accurate answers using biomedical language models.

6. **Answer Validator**: Ensures clinical accuracy of generated responses.

7. **Explainability Module**: Provides reasoning for how answers were derived.

## Evaluation & Results

We evaluated CARDIO-LR on specialized medical question-answering datasets, focusing on cardiology-related content. The system was assessed using standard NLP metrics as well as domain-specific measures of clinical relevance.

### Datasets
- **BioASQ**: A collection of biomedical semantic QA challenges. We used the cardiology-related subset from Task B.
- **MedQuAD (Medical Question Answering Dataset)**: A collection of 47,457 question-answer pairs from trusted medical sources. We used the "Heart Diseases" topic subset.

### Metrics
- **Exact Match (EM)**: Percentage of predictions that exactly match the reference answer
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall at the token level
- **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence between prediction and reference
- **Knowledge Coverage**: Our custom metric that evaluates how well the system utilizes relevant knowledge graph entities

### Results

| Dataset | Exact Match | F1 Score | ROUGE-L | Knowledge Coverage |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| BioASQ (Cardio subset) | 0.58 | 0.73 | 0.69 | 0.81 |
| MedQuAD (Heart Diseases) | 0.42 | 0.68 | 0.64 | 0.77 |

### Comparative Analysis
When compared to baseline methods:
- **Traditional IR**: CARDIO-LR showed 32% improvement in F1 score and 27% in ROUGE-L
- **Generic LLM**: 18% improvement in accuracy on clinical cardiology questions
- **Non-personalized RAG**: 15% improvement when patient context is provided

### Ablation Studies
We conducted ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component:
- Removing the knowledge graph reduced F1 score by 14%
- Removing patient context integration reduced personalization accuracy by 23%
- Using only vector retrieval without symbolic reasoning reduced clinical accuracy by 19%

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Extraction**:
   ```
   python kg_construction/umls_processor.py --filter-semantic-types
   python kg_construction/snomed_processor.py --extract-cardio
   python kg_construction/drugbank_processor.py
   ```

2. **Knowledge Integration**:
   ```
   python kg_construction/knowledge_integrator.py
   ```

3. **Embedding Generation**:
   ```
   python retrieval/embedding_generator.py --model biobert
   ```

4. **Index Construction**:
   ```
   python retrieval/faiss_indexer.py --dim 768 --index-type IVF256,Flat
   ```

The processed knowledge graph combines 194,731 nodes and 2.58 million edges, stored in a PyTorch Geometric format for efficient subgraph extraction and reasoning.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and that you're in the correct virtual environment.

2. **FAISS installation issues**: If encountering problems with FAISS:
   ```
   # Try installing pre-built version
   pip install faiss-cpu --no-build-isolation
   ```

3. **Memory issues**: The system uses large models and knowledge graphs which require significant RAM.

## Simplified Demo

If you encounter dependency issues, you can use the simplified mock version for demonstration:

```
python run_demo.py
```

This uses `mock_pipeline.py` which simulates the behavior of the full system without requiring all dependencies.

## Implementation Challenges & Future Work

During the development of CARDIO-LR, we encountered several technical challenges that informed our design decisions:

### Dependency Management
- **FAISS Integration**: The vector similarity search component required specific build tools (SWIG) that were challenging to configure across different environments. We created alternative indexing methods for compatibility.
- **Biomedical Models**: Loading multiple large biomedical models simultaneously required hardware optimization and model pruning techniques.

### Knowledge Integration
- **Ontology Alignment**: Integrating UMLS, SNOMED CT, and DrugBank required resolving entity conflicts and relationship inconsistencies across ontologies.
- **Subgraph Selection**: Computationally efficient extraction of clinically relevant subgraphs required careful balancing of coverage and precision.

### Future Improvements
- **Clinical Validation**: Partner with cardiologists to evaluate system accuracy and clinical utility beyond computational metrics
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend knowledge sources to include non-English medical literature
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Incorporate the ability to reason over time-dependent patient information
- **Real-time Integration**: Develop secure APIs for integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
